// What is a function?
'A function is a set of instructions that perform a specific task'
'or job'

// There are two variations of functions:
// Built-in functions: these are function instructions that 
// are already in the programming language and all you need to do 
// is pass it data.

// console.log() is an example of a built-in function
name = 'marquise smalley'
console.log(name)

// User defined functions: these are custom instuctions written
// engineers to make code that performs specific tasks.

// How do we write a user-defined function?
function exampleFunction(){
    console.log('The function script is connected')
}

// in order to have a function work, we need to call it.
// the above code is the function definition - MEANING - it's
// telling the computer the instructions- NOT to actually run

// we access or call a function by writing its name.
//exampleFunction()
let accountBalance = 100

const taxes =.07

function depositMoney(x){
    console. log('money has been added succesfully.')
    console.log(accountBalance + x)
}
