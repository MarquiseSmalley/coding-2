My Answers: 
'1. The difference between var, let, and const is that let has data will change, while const has data that wont change.'
'2. console (2 x 2 x 1000 = 4000)'
'3. A scenario where the let variable would be used is the date on your device. A scenario where the const variable would be used is the calculator apps format.' 
'4. Three things that could improve the class are group learning (class sepearated into multiple groups of different subjects), possible prizes for projects, and just a higher class work ethic.)
