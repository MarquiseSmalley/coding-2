// Strings = data bound together by quotation marks.
"this is a sentence wrapped in quotes- this is a string"

// variables = are containers for data
// when writing a variable, we break it down into 3 steps
// 1. declare the type of variable we're working with
// 2. we need to give the variables names
// 3. we need an equal sign
// 4. we need to give it a value/ data
var a ='// universal container- cant go wrong using this.'
let b ='// temporary variables- data that will change'
